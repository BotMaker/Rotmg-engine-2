Enemy spawner design — spawn near player but never overpopulate

Nice — here’s a compact, practical plan you can implement straight into your codebase. I’ll give you the principles, safety checks, and a working pseudocode/Euphoria-style example tuned to the style you’ve been using in the rest of your project.

Goals

Spawn enemies near the player (so they feel relevant) but not too close (avoid instant collisions / cheap deaths).

Always respect global and local caps so the world never gets swamped.

Keep spawning cheap and deterministic (use spawn pools, cooldowns, grid checks).

Make spawn decisions fast (use spatial partitioning: grid/quadtree).

Key parameters (tune these)

MAX_ENEMIES_GLOBAL — hard limit on total enemies alive (e.g. 200).

MAX_ENEMIES_NEAR_PLAYER — limit on how many may be within NEAR_RADIUS (e.g. 20).

SPAWN_RADIUS_MIN — min distance from player to spawn (prevent spawning right on top), e.g. 6–12 units.

SPAWN_RADIUS_MAX — max distance from player to spawn (keeps them relevant), e.g. 80–120 units.

SPAWN_COOLDOWN — time between spawn attempts (ms).

MAX_SPAWNS_PER_TICK — how many spawn attempts per tick (avoid huge bursts), e.g. 1–4.

SPAWN_POINT_COOLDOWN — time a spawn point must wait before reuse.

SPAWN_BUDGET — optional dynamic budget that increases/decreases with game difficulty.

CHECK_RADIUS_CLEARANCE — radius around candidate spawn point to ensure no obstacles / players / enemies overlap.

Core techniques

Global & local caps
Count alive_enemies_global. Also compute alive_near_player (use grid query). Only spawn if both below thresholds.

Spawn points / ring selection
Either maintain precomputed spawn points or generate candidate positions on a ring around the player between SPAWN_RADIUS_MIN and SPAWN_RADIUS_MAX. Precomputed points + cooldowns are easier to control (no bad nav).

Spatial partitioning
Use the same grid you already have for collision/enemy lookup to quickly count enemies near a position and test occupancy.

Clearance & LOS checks
For candidate pos, check:

Not inside solid tile

distance(candidate, player) >= SPAWN_RADIUS_MIN

distance(candidate, player) <= SPAWN_RADIUS_MAX

No other enemy inside CHECK_RADIUS_CLEARANCE

Optional: line-of-sight not necessary if you want surprise; do LOS if you want fair spawns.

Spawn throttling & cooldowns

Limit spawn attempts per frame.

Each spawn point has last_spawn_time to avoid immediate reuse.

Use randomized intervals to avoid predictable waves.

Object pooling
Reuse enemy objects (freelists) instead of allocating frequently.

Despawn rules
Remove or deactivate enemies when:

distance(player, enemy) > DESPAWN_DISTANCE and enemy is not currently engaged

off-screen + idle + too old

when global population needs to be reduced, pick the farthest idle enemies first.

Adaptive caps (optional)
Scale MAX_ENEMIES_NEAR_PLAYER by difficulty or performance (FPS).

Simple spawn algorithm (steps per tick)

If current_time >= next_spawn_time:

Compute alive_global. If >= MAX_ENEMIES_GLOBAL → skip.

Compute alive_near_player. If >= MAX_ENEMIES_NEAR_PLAYER → skip.

For i = 1..MAX_SPAWNS_PER_TICK:

pick spawn point (randomize)

if spawn point on cooldown → continue

validate candidate (clearance, nav, distance)

if valid → spawn enemy, set spawn point cooldown, decrement spawn budget, break or continue depending on MAX_SPAWNS_PER_TICK

set next_spawn_time = current_time + random_between(SPAWN_COOLDOWN * 0.8, SPAWN_COOLDOWN * 1.2)
