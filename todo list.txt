add 8 more inventory slots to button class make them invisible 
add loot bag
only when a the player is over a loot bag do you make the 8 more inventory slots invisible and usable
get enemy to drop loot bags after death loot drops
}

equipment that can shoot bullet that can hit multiple targets by going through the enemy's instead of using the exit button when projectile hits a enemy make sure not delete the projectile if it multiple targets
could add a arrow to point in the direction of the nearest enemy to the player

need to create another grid this time for the enemy because I intend to spawn them all at the start of a map 
use a grid so I call nearby on it to get a list of enemy near the player save having to iteration the whole list of enemy
active ones nearby to the player and deactivate was that are active once there out of range of the player
need to able to updated the enemy position in the grid just use a copy of grid.ew and rename it and name variables
piercing MultiHit 


add a key to nexus 
add health regen in the nexus 
add a portal to the world map in the nexus 

create chest to store items in don't have a vault map so would have to place them in the nexus 
need to create a chest class would be better to just modify the lootbag class remove the count down timer to despawn
and don't delete if loot bag is empty add a variable to loot bag class to say if its a loot bag or chest 
don't know if modfitying the lootbag class will work because when loading a new map all the loots bags are deleted 
I think need a global sequence call chest that holds all the chest and items that could be used to recreate the lootbags
every time the player is in the nexus 


when the player is in the nexus automatic regen health by 25 points every half a second 

maybe have the player position saved so when re entering the world map can position the player at the position it was at before entering the nexus or have randomly spawn some where on a beach like it does in the real game
